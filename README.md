## Carousel Components

> Started this project just to play around with different implementation of infinite carousels and I found many ways to do it and each way has the best implementation

> I will be covering those that I can document them here

### Description

### Carousel v1 aka ReusableCarousel1

> Don't the naming ðŸ˜‚

It is super easy to use

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let pages: [CustomPage] = [.init(color: .red), .init(color: .yellow), .init(color: .blue), .init(color: .pink), .init(color: .orange)]
    var body: some View {
        ReusableInfiniteCarousel1(pages: pages, showPageControls: true, pageControlOffset: -20) { page in
            RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 25)
                .fill(page.color)
        }
    }
}
```
It assumes that the views will be uniform for all tabs

**Implementation**

It was implemented with the usage of `PreferenceKey`.
Preference keys are a powerfull tool used in swiftUI to pass data from child level to parent level contrary to what we normally do, where we pass data from parent to child level.

**pages** takes in a model that conforms to `CustomIdentifiable` to take advantage of `customId`.

**Logic**

When the views are passed in, a new array is created that duplicated the first and last pages/view of the original array and changes their customId.

The custom preference key is used to observe the change in minX value of each view and sets it as offset.
